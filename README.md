### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
##### The app designed for this project will be called “HealthyApp2.” The app is designed for anyone of any age that would like to track their weight. All users will create an account and begin tracking their goal. The user will have the option to input whether they would like to maintain, lose, or gain weight. This app will allow the user to see their progress and achieve their final goal, whatever that may be. The user has the option to sign up for automated messages from our system through SMS to keep them informed and on track for daily weight tracking. The app will be easily accessible through the app store. The icon that represents HealthyApp2 will be a scale. Same image located on the login screen.
