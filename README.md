## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
##### The app designed for this project will be called “HealthyApp2.” The app is designed for anyone of any age that would like to track their weight. All users will create an account and begin tracking their goal. The user will have the option to input whether they would like to maintain, lose, or gain weight. This app will allow the user to see their progress and achieve their final goal, whatever that may be. The user has the option to sign up for automated messages from our system through SMS to keep them informed and on track for daily weight tracking. The app will be easily accessible through the app store. The icon that represents HealthyApp2 will be a scale. Same image located on the login screen. 

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
##### 

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
##### When the project planning first began, I had laid out the features that I wanted to incorporate within the app. I like to do a wireframe or UML diagram to help me see the big picture. This is a good way to see what is needed and the time it will take to finish. The approach that I take in most projects is an agile approach. No matter the stage that I am, iterations and testing often are key. I will always try to use this approach in future projects.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
##### Throughout the entire project, I used the emulator to see how the app was functioning. There were times that I would run the emulator but it would fail to open, or it would open and then crash. Even though I had no syntax errors, I used the emulator with the pixel 4xl phone layout, I was able to determine if the app functioned the way I designed it. The key step that helped me is testing often. My motto is to test early and test often. Write a little code and test it. 

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
##### Since my experience with Andriod Studio was a new, I had a few challenges to overcome in design and development. With design, I had to ensure that my UI made sense and was easy to navigate but still follow the Android guidelines. With development, It was difficult to implement code that functions. One small mistake can cause the entire project to fail. There were elements within each class that I had to be mindful of and useing the correct verbage to make them talk to eachother. The end result works well.

## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
##### Overall, the whole project was a new experience and I have gained a better understanding of Android Studio and the mobile app design process. The components within the project that I had more knowledge in was creating classes for the different functions within the app. With extensive research, I was able to incorporate the best industry techniques within my code.
